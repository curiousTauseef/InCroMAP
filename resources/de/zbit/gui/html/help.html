  <p><b>Short description:</b><br/>
  
InCroMAP is a powerful, easy-to-use high-level cross-platform microarray dataset analysis tool. It provides several methods to analyze or visualize single datasets, as well as methods to perform integrated cross-platform analysis. Currently mRNA, miRNA (microRNA), DNA methylation and protein (modification) data are supported. InCroMAP can, for example, visualize all platforms at once in a pathway, provide detailed information, e.g., about promoter methylation or perform integrated mRNA and microRNA analysis. In general, InCroMAP is a tool for generic or pathway-based analysis and visualization of heterogeneous, cross-platform datasets.
