  abstract = {Tumor promoters are non-mutagenic chemicals which increase the probability
	of cancer by accelerating the clonal expansion of cells transformed
	during tumor initiation. Phenobarbital (PB) is an antiepileptic drug
	which promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents when administered
	subsequent to an initiating carcinogen like diethylnitrosamine (DEN).
	Here we have investigated the prevalence and patterns of mutations
	in two genes, Ha-ras and beta-catenin, both known mutational targets
	in mouse hepatocarcinogenesis. Liver tumors were generated by a single
	administration of DEN to 6 week old mice followed by feeding of PB
	(0.05\%) containing or control diet for 39 weeks. Mutations at Ha-ras
	codon 61 were screened by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization;
	beta-catenin mutations were detected by direct sequencing of PCR
	products spanning exon 2. In tumors from mice treated with DEN alone,
	the prevalence of Ha-ras mutations was approximately 30\% (6/20),
	while no beta-catenin mutations (0/13) were detectable in tumors
	of this treatment group. By contrast, Ha-ras mutations were undetectable
	in tumors from mice treated with DEN/PB (0/32), while approximately
	80\% (37/46) of tumors from this group showed beta-catenin mutations.
	These results demonstrate that PB strongly affects the prevalence
	of mutations in the two cancer-related genes, presumably by positive
	and negative selection for cells harboring the respective mutation.},

	that leads to the fully differentiated state. This relies at least
	in part on the coordinated action of liver-enriched transcription
	factors (LETFs), but little is known about the dynamics of this coordination.
	In this context we investigate here the role of the LETF hepatocyte
	nuclear factor 6 (HNF-6; also called Onecut-1) during hepatocyte
	differentiation. We show that HNF-6 knockout mouse fetuses have delayed
	expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (g6pc), which catalyzes the final
	step of gluconeogenesis and is a late marker of hepatocyte maturation.
	Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro gain- and loss-of-function
	approaches, we demonstrate that HNF-6 stimulates endogenous g6pc
	gene expression directly via a synergistic and interdependent action
	with HNF-4 and that it involves coordinate recruitment of the coactivator
	PGC-1alpha. The expression of HNF-6, HNF-4, and PGC-1alpha rises
	steadily during liver development and precedes that of g6pc. We provide
	evidence that threshold levels of HNF-6 are required to allow synergism
	between HNF-6, HNF-4, and PGC-1alpha to induce time-specific expression
	of g6pc. Our observations on the regulation of g6pc by HNF-6 provide
	a model whereby synergism, interdependency, and threshold concentrations
	of LETFs and coactivators determine time-specific expression of genes
	during liver development.},

  abstract = {Although vertebrate DNA is generally depleted in the dinucleotide
	CpG, it has recently been shown that some vertebrate genes contain
	CpG islands, regions of DNA with a high G+C content and a high frequency
	of CpG dinucleotides relative to the bulk genome. In this study,
	a large number of sequences of vertebrate genes were screened for
	the presence of CpG islands. Each CpG island was then analysed in
	terms of length, nucleotide composition, frequency of CpG dinucleotides,
	and location relative to the transcription unit of the associated
	gene. CpG islands were associated with the 5' ends of all housekeeping
	genes and many tissue-specific genes, and with the 3' ends of some
	tissue-specific genes. A few genes contained both 5' and 3' CpG islands,
	separated by several thousand base-pairs of CpG-depleted DNA. The
	5' CpG islands extended through 5'-flanking DNA, exons and introns,
	whereas most of the 3' CpG islands appeared to be associated with
	exons. CpG islands were generally found in the same position relative
	to the transcription unit of equivalent genes in different species,
	with some notable exceptions. The locations of G/C boxes, composed
	of the sequence GGGCGG or its reverse complement CCGCCC, were investigated
	relative to the location of CpG islands. G/C boxes were found to
	be rare in CpG-depleted DNA and plentiful in CpG islands, where they
	occurred in 3' CpG islands, as well as in 5' CpG islands associated
	with tissue-specific and housekeeping genes. G/C boxes were located
	both upstream and downstream from the transcription start site of
	genes with 5' CpG islands. Thus, G/C boxes appeared to be a feature
	of CpG islands in general, rather than a feature of the promoter
	region of housekeeping genes. Two theories for the maintenance of
	a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands were tested:
	that CpG islands in methylated genomes are maintained, despite a
	tendency for 5mCpG to mutate by deamination to TpG+CpA, by the structural
	stability of a high G+C content alone, and that CpG islands associated
	with exons result from some selective importance of the arginine
	codon CGX. Neither of these theories could account for the distribution
	of CpG dinucleotides in the sequences analysed. Possible functions
	of CpG islands in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation
	of gene expression were discussed, and were related to theories for
	the maintenance of CpG islands as "methylation-free zones" in germline
	DNA.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, transcription of every protein-coding gene begins
	with the assembly of an RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex (PIC)
	on the promoter. The promoters, in conjunction with enhancers, silencers
	and insulators, define the combinatorial codes that specify gene
	expression patterns. Our ability to analyse the control logic encoded
	in the human genome is currently limited by a lack of accurate information
	regarding the promoters for most genes. Here we describe a genome-wide
	map of active promoters in human fibroblast cells, determined by
	experimentally locating the sites of PIC binding throughout the human
	genome. This map defines 10,567 active promoters corresponding to
	6,763 known genes and at least 1,196 un-annotated transcriptional
	units. Features of the map suggest extensive use of multiple promoters
	by the human genes and widespread clustering of active promoters
	in the genome. In addition, examination of the genome-wide expression
	profile reveals four general classes of promoters that define the
	transcriptome of the cell. These results provide a global view of
	the functional relationships among transcriptional machinery, chromatin
	structure and gene expression in human cells.},

	malignancy, for which there are no effective cures. Identification
	of a malignant stemlike subtype of HCC may offer patients with a
	dismal prognosis a potential targeted therapy using c-MET and Wnt

	a TRE-c-Met-driven transgenic HCC mouse model, we identified a cluster
	of 23 miRNAs that is encoded within the Dlk1-Gtl2 imprinted region
	on chromosome 12qF1 overexpressed in all of the isolated liver tumors.
	Interestingly, this region is conserved among mammalian species and
	maps to the human DLK1-DIO3 region on chromosome 14q32.2. We thus
	examined the expression of the DLK1-DIO3 miRNA cluster in a cohort
	of 97 hepatitis B virus-associated HCC patients and identified a
	subgroup (n = 18) of patients showing strong coordinate overexpression
	of miRNAs in this cluster but not in other cancer types (breast,
	lung, kidney, stomach, and colon) that were tested. Expression levels
	of imprinted gene transcripts from neighboring loci in this 14q32.2

	elevated in human HCC. Interestingly, overexpression of the DLK1-DIO3

	(CD133, CD90, EpCAM, Nestin) and associated with a high level of
	serum alpha-fetoprotein, a conventional biomarker for liver cancer,
	and poor survival rate in HCC patients. In conclusion, our findings

	We recently demonstrated that Cx32 is essential for phenobarbital

	Cx26 plays a similar role, an initiation-promotion experiment was
	conducted using mice with a liver-specific knockout of Cx26. Control

	(DEN, 90 microg/g b.wt.) at 6 weeks of age and groups of mice were
	subsequently kept on a PB (0.05\%) containing or control diet for
	35 weeks. At the end of the experiment, the carcinogenic response
	in the liver was monitored. Mice from PB treatment groups showed
	strongly increased liver weights compared with mice treated with
	DEN alone, which was mostly due to a much higher tumor burden. The
	tumor response in PB-treated mice of both strains was quite similar,
	but the number of smaller tumors and of enzyme-altered neoplastic
	lesions was somewhat larger in PB-treated Cx26 knockout (Cx26 KO)
	compared with wild-type mice, whereas the volume fraction of enzyme-altered
	lesions was slightly reduced in PB-treated Cx26-deficient mice. There
	was no significant difference in tumor prevalence between Cx26 KO
	and wild-type mice. Altogether our present data show that elimination
	of Cx26 has only minor effects on chemically induced mouse hepatocarcinogenesis,
	in striking contrast to the effects seen in Cx32 KO mice.},

	However, a proportion of these malignancies have little or no expression
	of EGFR. CpG island hypermethylation and associated transcriptional
	silencing are common in solid tumors. The methylation status of the
	EGFR CpG island was examined in a series of cell lines and tissues.
	Dense EGFR methylation (90\%) was found in the breast cancer cell
	line CAMA1, and a moderate degree of methylation (30-50\%) was observed
	in the breast cancer cell lines MB435 and MB453. Transcriptional
	silencing of EGFR in these cell lines closely correlated with methylation.
	By contrast, no methylation of the HER-2/ neu CpG island was detected.
	EGFR hypermethylation was also found in a subset of unselected primary
	breast (20\%), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (35\%), and
	lung tumors (11\%). Treatment with decitabine resulted in the reexpression

  abstract = {Cancer is caused by a complex pattern of molecular perturbations.
	To understand the biology of cancer, it is thus important to look
	at the activation state of key proteins and signaling networks. The
	limited amount of available sample material from patients and the
	complexity of protein expression patterns make the use of traditional
	protein analysis methods particularly difficult. In addition, the
	only approach that is currently available for performing functional
	studies is the use of serial biopsies, which is limited by ethical
	constraints and patient acceptance. The goal of this work was to
	establish a 3-D ex vivo culture technique in combination with reverse-phase
	protein microarrays (RPPM) as a novel experimental tool for use in
	cancer research. The RPPM platform allows the parallel profiling
	of large numbers of protein analytes to determine their relative
	abundance and activation level. Cancer tissue and the respective
	corresponding normal tissue controls from patients with colorectal
	cancer were cultured ex vivo. At various time points, the cultured
	samples were processed into lysates and analyzed on RPPM to assess
	the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and 24 proteins
	involved in the regulation of apoptosis. The methodology displayed
	good robustness and low system noise. As a proof of concept, CEA
	expression was significantly higher in tumor compared with normal
	tissue (p<0.0001). The caspase 9 expression signal was lower in tumor
	tissue than in normal tissue (p<0.001). Cleaved Caspase 8 (p=0.014),
	Bad (p=0.007), Bim (p=0.007), p73 (p=0.005), PARP (p<0.001), and
	cleaved PARP (p=0.007) were differentially expressed in normal liver
	and normal colon tissue. We demonstrate here the feasibility of using
	RPPM technology with 3-D ex vivo cultured samples. This approach
	is useful for investigating complex patterns of protein expression
	and modification over time. It should allow functional proteomics
	in patient samples with various applications such as pharmacodynamic
	analyses in drug development.},

	agent. Methylation appears to influence gene expression by affecting
	the interactions with DNA of both chromatin proteins and specific
	transcription factors. Although methylation patterns are very stable

	specific and appears to involve an active mechanism which takes place
	in the absence of DNA replication. The X chromosome undergoes inactivation
	during development; this is accompanied by de novo methylation, which
	appears necessary to stably maintain its silent state. As opposed

	HCCs with activated beta-catenin displayed a gene expression profile
	that was similar to Catnb-mutated mouse tumors but distinct from
	the other human HCCs. In conclusion, expression fingerprints may
	be used for diagnostic purposes and potential new therapeutic intervention

  abstract = {The antiepileptic drug phenobarbital (PB) is used frequently as a
	model tumor promoter in rodent liver. It is believed to increase
	the probability of cancer by accelerating the clonal expansion of
	cells transformed during tumor initiation. The molecular mechanism
	underlying this process is only partly understood but seems to require
	the function of connexin32 (Cx32), one of the 2 gap junction proteins
	expressed in hepatocytes. PB mediates transcriptional activation
	of various genes in liver but which of these are relevant for tumor
	promotion is unknown. We have used oligonucleotide microarrays to
	identify genes differentially modulated in expression by PB in liver
	of Cx32-wild-type and Cx32-null mice. Mice of both strains were kept
	on PB containing (0.05\%) or control diet for 2 weeks. Total liver
	RNA was isolated from 3 mice per experimental group and reverse transcribed;
	cDNAs were hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays and a gene-by-gene
	linear model was used for statistical analysis of data. Five genes
	were identified as induced or repressed in untreated Cx32-null as
	compared to untreated Cx32-wild-type mice. PB affected the expression
	of 53 genes, of which 13 code for members of Phase-I/II of drug metabolism,
	and 12 genes were differentially affected in expression by PB in
	Cx32-null as compared to Cx32-wild-type mice. Among the differentially
	affected genes that could be verified by quantitative RT-PCR or Western
	analysis were the insulin like growth factor binding protein-1, retinol
	dehydrogenase-6 and the Y-chromosomally located gene Dby, among which
	may be a candidate of relevance for PB-mediated tumor promotion.},

	The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package,
