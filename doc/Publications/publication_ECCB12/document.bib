  title = {Microarray technology: beyond transcript profiling and genotype analysis.},

  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {200--210},
  number = {3},
  month = {Mar},
  abstract = {Understanding complex functional mechanisms requires the global and
	parallel analysis of different cellular processes. DNA microarrays
	have become synonymous with this kind of study and, in many cases,
	are the obvious platform to achieve this aim. They have already made
	important contributions, most notably to gene-expression studies,
	although the true potential of this technology is far greater. Whereas
	some assays, such as transcript profiling and genotyping, are becoming
	routine, others are still in the early phases of development, and
	new areas of application, such as genome-wide epigenetic analysis
	and on-chip synthesis, continue to emerge.},

  title = {The human genome browser at {UCSC}.},

  volume = {12},
  pages = {996--1006},
  number = {6},
  month = {Jun},
  abstract = {As vertebrate genome sequences near completion and research refocuses
	to their analysis, the issue of effective genome annotation display
	becomes critical. A mature web tool for rapid and reliable display
	of any requested portion of the genome at any scale, together with
	several dozen aligned annotation tracks, is provided at http://genome.ucsc.edu.
	This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed
	sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species
	homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites,
	radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of
	coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick
	and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary
	links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary
	off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed
	at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available
	sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can
	stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational
	or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the
	browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described.
	The web site currently serves over 50,000 pages per day to over 3000
	different users.},

  title = {KEGGtranslator: visualizing and converting the KEGG PATHWAY database
	to various formats.},
  journal = {Bioinformatics},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {27},
  pages = {2314--2315},
  number = {16},
  month = {Aug},
  abstract = {The KEGG PATHWAY database provides a widely used service for metabolic
	and nonmetabolic pathways. It contains manually drawn pathway maps
	with information about the genes, reactions and relations contained
	therein. To store these pathways, KEGG uses KGML, a proprietary XML-format.
	Parsers and translators are needed to process the pathway maps for
	usage in other applications and algorithms. We have developed KEGGtranslator,
	an easy-to-use stand-alone application that can visualize and convert
	KGML formatted XML-files into multiple output formats. Unlike other
	translators, KEGGtranslator supports a plethora of output formats,
	is able to augment the information in translated documents (e.g.
	MIRIAM annotations) beyond the scope of the KGML document, and amends
	missing components to fragmentary reactions within the pathway to
	allow simulations on those.KEGGtranslator is freely available as
	a Java(™) Web Start application and for download at http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/KEGGtranslator/.
	KGML files can be downloaded from within the application.clemens.wrzodek@uni-tuebingen.deSupplementary
	data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
