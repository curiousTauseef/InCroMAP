  title = {Microarray technology: beyond transcript profiling and genotype analysis.},

  volume = {7},
  pages = {200--210},
  number = {3},
  month = {Mar},
  abstract = {Understanding complex functional mechanisms requires the global and
	parallel analysis of different cellular processes. DNA microarrays
	have become synonymous with this kind of study and, in many cases,
	are the obvious platform to achieve this aim. They have already made
	important contributions, most notably to gene-expression studies,
	although the true potential of this technology is far greater. Whereas
	some assays, such as transcript profiling and genotyping, are becoming
	routine, others are still in the early phases of development, and
	new areas of application, such as genome-wide epigenetic analysis
	and on-chip synthesis, continue to emerge.},

  title = {The human genome browser at {UCSC}.},

  number = {6},

  abstract = {As vertebrate genome sequences near completion and research refocuses
	to their analysis, the issue of effective genome annotation display
	becomes critical. A mature web tool for rapid and reliable display
	of any requested portion of the genome at any scale, together with
	several dozen aligned annotation tracks, is provided at http://genome.ucsc.edu.
	This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed
	sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species
	homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites,
	radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of
	coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick
	and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary
	links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary
	off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed
	at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available
	sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can
	stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational
	or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the
	browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described.
	The web site currently serves over 50,000 pages per day to over 3000
	different users.},
