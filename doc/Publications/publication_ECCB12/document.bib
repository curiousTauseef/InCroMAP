	model that takes into account the probe affinity effect. To obtain
	a normalized microRNA signal useful for the statistical analysis,
	AgiMicroRna offers the possibility of employing either the processed
	signal estimated by the robust multiarray average algorithm or the
	processed signal produced by the Agilent image analysis software.
	The AgiMicroRNA package also incorporates different graphical utilities
	to assess the quality of the data. AgiMicroRna uses the linear model

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: An increasingly common application of gene expression
	profile data is the reverse engineering of cellular networks. However,
	common procedures to normalize expression profiles generated using
	the Affymetrix GeneChips technology were originally developed for
	a rather different purpose, namely the accurate measure of differential
	gene expression between two or more phenotypes. As a result, current
	evaluation strategies lack comprehensive metrics to assess the suitability
	of available normalization procedures for reverse engineering and,
	in general, for measuring correlation between the expression profiles
	of a gene pair. RESULTS: We benchmark four commonly used normalization
	procedures (MAS5, RMA, GCRMA and Li-Wong) in the context of established
	algorithms for the reverse engineering of protein-protein and protein-DNA
	interactions. Replicate sample, randomized and human B-cell data
	sets are used as an input. Surprisingly, our study suggests that
	MAS5 provides the most faithful cellular network reconstruction.
	Furthermore, we identify a crucial step in GCRMA responsible for
	introducing severe artifacts in the data leading to a systematic
	overestimate of pairwise correlation. This has key implications not
	only for reverse engineering but also for other methods, such as
	hierarchical clustering, relying on accurate measurements of pairwise
	expression profile correlation. We propose an alternative implementation
	to eliminate such side effect.},

  abstract = {KEGG Atlas is a new graphical interface to the KEGG suite of databases,
	especially to the systems information in the PATHWAY and BRITE databases.
	It currently consists of a single global map and an associated viewer
	for metabolism, covering about 120 KEGG metabolic pathway maps and
	about 10 BRITE hierarchies. The viewer allows the user to navigate
	and zoom the global map under the Ajax technology. The mapping of
	high-throughput experimental data onto the global map is the main
	use of KEGG Atlas. In the global metabolism map, the node (circle)
	is a chemical compound and the edge (line) is a set of reactions
	linked to a set of KEGG Orthology (KO) entries for enzyme genes.
	Once gene identifiers in different organisms are converted to the
	K number identifiers in the KO system, corresponding line segments
	can be highlighted in the global map, allowing the user to view genome
	sequence data as organism-specific pathways, gene expression data
	as up- or down-regulated pathways, etc. Once chemical compounds are
	converted to the C number identifiers in KEGG, metabolomics data
	can also be displayed in the global map. KEGG Atlas is available
	at http://www.genome.jp/kegg/atlas/.},

	microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002)
	derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression
	in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical
	parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical
	model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for
	general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments
	and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear
	models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The
	approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color
	microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived
	for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have
	robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete
	data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior
	odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic
	in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place
	of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is
	equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards
	a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the
	number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has
	the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters
	which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the
	non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated
	t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees
	of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate
	tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics.
	The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study.
