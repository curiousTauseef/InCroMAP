	In this method, unmethylated and methylated DNA fractions are enriched

	aspects of the technology including its replicability, informativeness,
	sensitivity and optimal PCR conditions using microarrays containing
	oligonucleotides representing 100 kb of genomic DNA derived from
	the chromosome 22 COMT region in addition to 12 192 element CpG island

	including the parallel identification of confounding effects of DNA
	sequence variation, the description of the principles of microarray
	design for epigenomic studies and the optimal choice of methylation
	sensitive restriction enzymes. We also demonstrate the advantages
	of using the unmethylated DNA fraction versus the methylated one,
	which substantially improve the chances of detecting DNA methylation
	differences. We applied this methodology for fine-mapping of methylation
	patterns of chromosomes 21 and 22 in eight individuals using tiling
	microarrays consisting of over 340 000 oligonucleotide probe pairs.

	while the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration
	data has grown by a factor of five (from 883 to 4413). Similarly,
