	'GeneTrail' that offers a rich functionality and is easy to use.
	Our web-based application facilitates the statistical evaluation
	of high-throughput genomic or proteomic data sets with respect to
	enrichment of functional categories. GeneTrail covers a wide variety
	of biological categories and pathways, among others KEGG, TRANSPATH,
	TRANSFAC, and GO. Our web server provides two common statistical
	approaches, 'Over-Representation Analysis' (ORA) comparing a reference
	set of genes to a test set, and 'Gene Set Enrichment Analysis' (GSEA)
	scoring sorted lists of genes. Besides other newly developed features,
	GeneTrail's statistics module includes a novel dynamic-programming
	algorithm that improves the P-value computation of GSEA methods considerably.
	GeneTrail is freely accessible at http://genetrail.bioinf.uni-sb.de.},

  abstract = {DNA Microarrays have become the standard method for large scale analyses
	of gene expression and epigenomics. The increasing complexity and
	inherent noisiness of the generated data makes visual data exploration
	ever more important. Fast deployment of new methods as well as a
	combination of predefined, easy to apply methods with programmer's
	access to the data are important requirements for any analysis framework.
	Mayday is an open source platform with emphasis on visual data exploration
	and analysis. Many built-in methods for clustering, machine learning
	and classification are provided for dissecting complex datasets.
	Plugins can easily be written to extend Mayday's functionality in
	a large number of ways. As Java program, Mayday is platform-independent
	and can be used as Java WebStart application without any installation.
	Mayday can import data from several file formats, database connectivity
	is included for efficient data organization. Numerous interactive
	visualization tools, including box plots, profile plots, principal
	component plots and a heatmap are available, can be enhanced with
	metadata and exported as publication quality vector files.We have
	rewritten large parts of Mayday's core to make it more efficient
	and ready for future developments. Among the large number of new
	plugins are an automated processing framework, dynamic filtering,
	new and efficient clustering methods, a machine learning module and
	database connectivity. Extensive manual data analysis can be done
	using an inbuilt R terminal and an integrated SQL querying interface.
	Our visualization framework has become more powerful, new plot types
	have been added and existing plots improved.We present a major extension
	of Mayday, a very versatile open-source framework for efficient micro
	array data analysis designed for biologists and bioinformaticians.
	Most everyday tasks are already covered. The large number of available
	plugins as well as the extension possibilities using compiled plugins
	and ad-hoc scripting allow for the rapid adaption of Mayday also
	to very specialized data exploration. Mayday is available at http://microarray-analysis.org.},
