  abstract = {Linking plant phenotype to gene and protein expression and also to
	metabolite synthesis and accumulation is one of the main challenges
	for improving agricultural production worldwide. Such a challenge
	is particularly relevant to crop nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Here,
	the differences in leaf gene transcript, protein, and metabolite
	accumulation in maize subjected to long-term nitrogen (N)-deficient
	growth conditions at two important stages of plant development have
	been studied. The impact of N deficiency was examined at the transcriptomic,
	proteomic, and metabolomic levels. It was found that a number of
	key plant biological functions were either up- or down-regulated
	when N was limiting, including major alterations to photosynthesis,
	carbon (C) metabolism, and, to a lesser extent, downstream metabolic
	pathways. It was also found that the impact of the N deficiency stress
	resembled the response of plants to a number of other biotic and
	abiotic stresses, in terms of transcript, protein, and metabolite
	accumulation. The genetic and metabolic alterations were different
	during the N assimilation and the grain-filling period, indicating
	that plant development is an important component for identifying
	the key elements involved in the control of plant NUE. It was also
	found that integration of the three 'omics' studies is not straightforward,
	since different levels of regulation seem to occur in a stepwise
	manner from gene expression to metabolite accumulation. The potential
	use of these 'omics' studies is discussed with a view to improve
	our understanding of whole plant nitrogen economics, which should
	have applications in breeding and agronomy.},

  abstract = {DNA Microarrays have become the standard method for large scale analyses
	of gene expression and epigenomics. The increasing complexity and
	inherent noisiness of the generated data makes visual data exploration
	ever more important. Fast deployment of new methods as well as a
	combination of predefined, easy to apply methods with programmer's
	access to the data are important requirements for any analysis framework.
	Mayday is an open source platform with emphasis on visual data exploration
	and analysis. Many built-in methods for clustering, machine learning
	and classification are provided for dissecting complex datasets.
	Plugins can easily be written to extend Mayday's functionality in
	a large number of ways. As Java program, Mayday is platform-independent
	and can be used as Java WebStart application without any installation.
	Mayday can import data from several file formats, database connectivity
	is included for efficient data organization. Numerous interactive
	visualization tools, including box plots, profile plots, principal
	component plots and a heatmap are available, can be enhanced with
	metadata and exported as publication quality vector files.We have
	rewritten large parts of Mayday's core to make it more efficient
	and ready for future developments. Among the large number of new
	plugins are an automated processing framework, dynamic filtering,
	new and efficient clustering methods, a machine learning module and
	database connectivity. Extensive manual data analysis can be done
	using an inbuilt R terminal and an integrated SQL querying interface.
	Our visualization framework has become more powerful, new plot types
	have been added and existing plots improved.We present a major extension
	of Mayday, a very versatile open-source framework for efficient micro
	array data analysis designed for biologists and bioinformaticians.
	Most everyday tasks are already covered. The large number of available
	plugins as well as the extension possibilities using compiled plugins
	and ad-hoc scripting allow for the rapid adaption of Mayday also
	to very specialized data exploration. Mayday is available at http://microarray-analysis.org.},

  abstract = {The LIPID MAPS Structure Database (LMSD) is a relational database
	encompassing structures and annotations of biologically relevant
	lipids. Structures of lipids in the database come from four sources:
	(i) LIPID MAPS Consortium's core laboratories and partners; (ii)
	lipids identified by LIPID MAPS experiments; (iii) computationally
	generated structures for appropriate lipid classes; (iv) biologically
	relevant lipids manually curated from LIPID BANK, LIPIDAT and other
	public sources. All the lipid structures in LMSD are drawn in a consistent
	fashion. In addition to a classification-based retrieval of lipids,
	users can search LMSD using either text-based or structure-based
	search options. The text-based search implementation supports data
	retrieval by any combination of these data fields: LIPID MAPS ID,
	systematic or common name, mass, formula, category, main class, and
	subclass data fields. The structure-based search, in conjunction
	with optional data fields, provides the capability to perform a substructure
	search or exact match for the structure drawn by the user. Search
	results, in addition to structure and annotations, also include relevant
	links to external databases. The LMSD is publicly available at www.lipidmaps.org/data/structure/.},

	selective clonal outgrowth of cells harboring oncogene mutations
	in Ctnnb1, while spontaneous or DEN-only-induced tumors are often

	versus spontaneously occurring liver tumors. Here, we have characterized
	mouse liver tumors harboring either Ctnnb1 or Ha-ras mutations via
	integrated molecular profiling at the transcriptional, translational
	and post-translational levels. In addition, metabolites of the intermediary
	metabolism were quantified by high resolution (1) H magic angle nuclear
	magnetic resonance. We have identified tumor genotype-specific differences
	in mRNA and miRNA expression, protein levels, post-translational
	modifications, and metabolite levels that facilitate the molecular
	and biochemical stratification of tumor phenotypes. Bioinformatic
	integration of these data at the pathway level led to novel insights
	into tumor genotype-specific aberrant cell signaling and in particular
	to a better understanding of alterations in pathways of the cell
	intermediary metabolism, which are driven by the constitutive activation
	of the β-Catenin and Ha-ras oncoproteins in tumors of the two genotypes.},

	annotated resource that is designed to address the broad needs of
	biochemists, clinical chemists, physicians, medical geneticists,
	nutritionists and members of the metabolomics community. Since its
	first release in 2007, the HMDB has been used to facilitate the research
	for nearly 100 published studies in metabolomics, clinical biochemistry
	and systems biology. The most recent release of HMDB (version 2.0)
	has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the previous release
	(version 1.0). In particular, the number of fully annotated metabolite
	entries has grown from 2180 to more than 6800 (a 300\% increase),
	while the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration
	data has grown by a factor of five (from 883 to 4413). Similarly,
	the number of purified compounds with reference to NMR, LC-MS and
	GC-MS spectra has more than doubled (from 380 to more than 790 compounds).
	In addition to this significant expansion in database size, many
	new database searching tools and new data content has been added
	or enhanced. These include better algorithms for spectral searching
	and matching, more powerful chemical substructure searches, faster
	text searching software, as well as dedicated pathway searching tools
	and customized, clickable metabolic maps. Changes to the user-interface
	have also been implemented to accommodate future expansion and to
	make database navigation much easier. These improvements should make
	the HMDB much more useful to a much wider community of users.},

  abstract = {Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a widely used technique in
	transcriptomic data analysis that uses a database of predefined gene
	sets to rank lists of genes from microarray studies to identify significant
	and coordinated changes in gene expression data. While GSEA has been
	playing a significant role in understanding transcriptomic data,
	no similar tools are currently available for understanding metabolomic
	data. Here, we introduce a web-based server, called Metabolite Set
	Enrichment Analysis (MSEA), to help researchers identify and interpret
	patterns of human or mammalian metabolite concentration changes in
	a biologically meaningful context. Key to the development of MSEA
	has been the creation of a library of approximately 1000 predefined
	metabolite sets covering various metabolic pathways, disease states,
	biofluids, and tissue locations. MSEA also supports user-defined
	or custom metabolite sets for more specialized analysis. MSEA offers
	three different enrichment analyses for metabolomic studies including
	overrepresentation analysis (ORA), single sample profiling (SSP)
	and quantitative enrichment analysis (QEA). ORA requires only a list
	of compound names, while SSP and QEA require both compound names
	and compound concentrations. MSEA generates easily understood graphs
	or tables embedded with hyperlinks to relevant pathway images and
	disease descriptors. For non-mammalian or more specialized metabolomic
	studies, MSEA allows users to provide their own metabolite sets for
	enrichment analysis. The MSEA server also supports conversion between
	metabolite common names, synonyms, and major database identifiers.
	MSEA has the potential to help users identify obvious as well as
	'subtle but coordinated' changes among a group of related metabolites
	that may go undetected with conventional approaches. MSEA is freely
	available at http://www.msea.ca.},
