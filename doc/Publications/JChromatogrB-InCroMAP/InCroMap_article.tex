%% Text of abstract
In systems biology, the combination of multiple types of omics data, such as metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, yields more information on a biological process than the analysis of a single type of data. Today, data from different omics platforms is usually combined in one experimental setup to obtain insight into a biological process or a disease state. Particularly high accuracy metabolomics data from modern mass spectrometry instruments is more and more integrated into biological studies. Reflecting this trend, we updated InCroMAP to allow for the integration of metabolomics data. The tool is able to perform an integrated enrichment analysis and pathway-based visualization of metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data.

\section{Introduction}
Today, high-throughput methods for the analysis of biological systems, such as microarrays, next generation sequencing, and mass spectrometry generate a wealth of genome-scale data. To develop hypotheses about a biological process or a disease state, a variety of omics-platforms for measuring different genomic, proteomic, and metabolic features are combined in one experimental setup. Probably the most prominent genomic feature is messenger RNA (mRNA), which can be quantified on a genome-wide level by gene expression chips (microarrays) or next generation sequencing techniques. Other important (epi)genomic features include microRNA (miRNA), single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and epigenetic information, such as the promoter methylation status (DNAm). Proteomic features can be derived from abundance profiling of particular protein isoforms and posttranslational modifications, such as methylation and phosphorylation. Furthermore, modern mass spectrometry platforms are able to detect and measure the relative 
intensity of thousands of metabolites with high accuracy. The sensible and integrated visualization of omics data at different levels of abstraction is crucial to obtain biological insight without being overwhelmed by the intrinsic complexity of the data \cite{Gehlenborg2010}. A key concept for detecting alterations in cell signalling or metabolism in a biological system are pathway-based visualizations.

A plethora of tools were developed for the inspection of data from individual platforms (see \cite{Gehlenborg2010} for examples). Furthermore, solutions for the combined visualization of transcriptomics (mRNA) and metabolomics data exist \cite{Garcia-Alcalde2011,Waegele2012}. Both Paintomics \cite{Garcia-Alcalde2011} and MassTRIX \cite{Waegele2012} are web-service based tools that are capable of visualizing mRNA microarray and identified metabolomics data in KEGG \cite{Kanehisa2006} pathways. MassTRIX is able to handle unidentified metabolic data by comparing each mass against theoretical adducts stored in metabolomics databases. An example of a tool that can handle several heterogeneous types of omics data is the commercial Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (www.ingenuity.com). However, Ingenuity does not provide an integrated visualization of multi-level omics data. In summary, most high-level analysis tools are not freely available, focused on certain specialized platforms, or not able to perform an integrated analysis of multiple types of omics platforms. Thus, novel analysis tools and appropriate visualizations are required, since complex interactions between multiple layers of gene regulation can only be inferred by the integration of omics data sets across multiple platforms.

In this contribution we present an extended version of the tool InCroMAP \cite{Wrzodek2012a,Wrzodek2012b}. InCroMAP is a stand-alone Java software which offers enrichment analysis and pathway-based visualizations for genomic and proteomic data, where multiple biological layers were monitored in the same set of samples. The application was developed to provide a high ease of use. Consequently, all information required, for example, for the mapping between different feature identifiers or the annotation of miRNAs with mRNA targets, is either directly included in the tool or dynamically downloaded in the background. Previous versions of InCroMAP were designed for the combined analysis of a wide variety of omics platform types, where each feature can be linked to a gene or genomic interval. Hence, metabolomics data was not supported. In the extended version of InCroMAP presented here, we also support the enrichment analysis and pathway-based visualization of annotated metabolomics data. For convenience, InCroMAP supports several commonly used compound identifiers, such as specific database identifiers (e.g. HMDB \cite{Wishart2009}) and automatically recognizes common compound names or IUPAC names. 

InCroMAP is freely available under the LGPL3 license at http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/InCroMAP, including a comprehensive user’s guide and several example data files to test the capabilities of the tool.

\section{Methods}
Before systems biology data from heterogeneous platforms can be integrated and visualized with high-level data analysis tools like InCroMAP, the data has to be preprocessed in a platform-dependent manner (see Figure \ref{fig:incromap-workflow}). A typical workflow for metabolomics data from untargeted mass spectrometry measurements includes the following steps. First, metabolic features, which are characterized by mass and relative intensity, are extracted from the raw data files with feature finding and feature extraction algorithms. Ideally, the feature induced by a metabolite should contain all signals that were generated by the metabolite. Second, the extracted features have to be aligned and linked between the different samples. The aforementioned preprocessing steps can be performed with sophisticated open-source software tools like OpenMS \cite{Sturm2008}. The  features are then subjected to quality controls and low-level statistical data analysis, which includes normalization and calculation of measures for differential abundance between conditions (e.g. p-values, fold changes, or log ratios). Mostly, these tasks are performed with commercial statistics software, open-source omics analysis applications like Mayday \cite{Battke2010}, or directly with the statistical programming language R (www.r-project.org). In a final preprocessing step, the metabolite features are annotated with candidate identifiers using information provided by metabolomics databases, such as PubChem \cite{Wang2009}, HMDB \cite{Wishart2009}, or LIPID MAPS \cite{Sud2007}. Similar preprocessing workflows exist for other platforms, like microarrays and next generation sequencing. The processed data can then be imported and analyzed with InCroMAP.

In a typical use case of InCroMAP (see Figure \ref{fig:incromap-workflow}), the user first imports his preprocessed multi-level omics data, given in tabular format. Then, the differentially expressed metabolites or genes are determined for each platform based on appropriate cutoffs. Next, relevant pathways related to the biological background of the experiments are inferred. For the detection of relevant pathways, InCroMAP employs a special pathway enrichment algorithm which integrates differentially expressed metabolites and genes across multiple platforms. The resulting pathways can then be selected for further visual inspection from a table in which each pathway is associated with a significance value. Alternatively, the metabolic overview function of InCroMAP can be used to generate an interactive global map of cellular metabolism, in which each subordinate metabolic pathway is colored according to the significance of its enrichment. The results of the enrichment analysis can be exported in tabular format and the pathway-based visualizations can be easily stored as JPEG images.

\caption{The flow chart depicts the general workflow of an analysis with InCroMAP. The raw data from each platform is preprocessed using appropriate, platform-specific algorithms for data preparation (e.g., feature extraction) and the alleviation of experimental artifacts (e.g., normalization techniques). Then, the data is analyzed with a statistics software, which yields p-values or fold changes for each of the features. Finally, the gene and metabolite features are annotated with candidate identifiers. After these preprocessing steps the data can be easily imported to InCroMAP and an enrichment analysis can be performed. On the basis of the enrichment, the user may select a pathway of interest, which can be overlaid with the corresponding omics data. Alternatively, a visualization showing a global overview of the metabolic alterations can be generated.}

\subsection{Data import}
For an import to InCroMAP the data has to be in a tabular format, which can be easily obtained by MS Excel export functions. Furthermore, each measurement must contain at least some identifier and an observation (p-value, fold-change, or log ratio) that captures the difference between experimental conditions. InCroMAP is able to handle various types of identifiers for transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data. It supports the automatic recognition of identifiers used by the most common oligonucleotide microarray manufacturers (e.g., Affymetrix, Agilent, etc.) and generic formats to enable the import of processed data, provided that each measurement can be either associated to a certain gene, genomic region, or metabolite. Metabolomics data may be annotated by a database identifier (e.g. KEGG, HMDB, PubChem, LIPID MAPS) or by a common synonym or IUPAC name. Pathways of interest can either be automatically downloaded from KEGG or imported from other sources in BioPAX format. 

\subsection{Enrichment analysis}
A common algorithm for performing an enrichment of gene sets is an overrepresentation analysis \cite{Backes2007}, which uses a hypergeometric test to calculate a significance value for each predefined gene set. InCroMAP extends the method to provide an integrated enrichment across multiple platforms. The overrepresentation analysis requires a fixed set of up- or downregulated genes or metabolites, which are obtained by a user-defined fold change and/or p-value cutoff for each of the platform-dependent data sets. Currently, InCroMAP supports the enrichment of KEGG pathways, of gene sets from the molecular signatures database (MSigDB), and of gene ontology (GO) terms. The result of a KEGG pathway enrichment is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:incromap-workflow}, where each pathway is assigned a p-value and an FDR corrected p-value (q-value).

\subsection{Metabolic overview}
The results of a pathway enrichment analysis are typically presented to the user as a table or barplot of pathways, sorted according to the associated p-values, which score the significance of the enrichment with deregulated genes. As these traditional representations of an enrichment result do not highlight any functional relations between pathways we devised an alternative method, which provides the user with a more structured view of the metabolic pathways altered in a certain experiment. Using the metabolic overview feature, the user can display enrichment results in the context of the KEGG's global `Metabolic Pathways' map (KEGG: map01100), which contains references to all subordinate metabolic KEGG pathways. In this illustration pathways which are significantly enriched with deregulated genes are highlighted in blue (Figure 2A). Since KEGG does not offer a meta-pathway for cellular signal transduction, this feature is limited to metabolic pathways.

\subsection{Pathway-based visualization}
Metabolic or signalling pathways of interest can either be automatically downloaded from KEGG or imported from other sources in BioPAX format. Being rendered in an interactive graph viewer, the pathway nodes representing genes can be overlaid with expression data from mRNAs and multiple protein products (Figure 2B). Additionally, miRNAs can be connected to a given pathway based on experimentally confirmed or predicted interactions to their target mRNAs. If desired, the tool also visualizes differential methylation of proximal gene promoters, which is by default computed based on the largest peak observed in the upstream region of the transcription start site. In the current version of InCroMAP we also support the visualization of metabolomics data. For each pathway node corresponding to a gene, the individual measurements derived from multiple platforms and/or probesets as well as the DNA methylation profile of the proximal promoter can be inspected in a separate details panel. 

\section{Results and discussion}
We presented an extended version of InCroMAP, which allows the integrated pathway-based visualization of data from multiple omics platforms, such as metabolome data, mRNA, miRNA, protein modifications, and DNAm. The tool enables a user to interactively browse through and visualize different KEGG pathways. Furthermore, the metabolic overview function of InCroMAP can be used to generate an interactive global map of cellular metabolism, which provides a structured view of the metabolic changes present in a certain experimental condition. Thus, the tool provides a useful overview of multi-omics data in the context of metabolic and signalling pathways, which enables the generation of initial biological hypotheses. 

The ability to handle metabolimics data results in limitations of the current pathway enrichment method. The annotation of untargeted metabolomics data sets usually results in many-to-many mappings because a metabolic feature can be mapped to several candidate identifiers and vice versa. The overrepresentation analysis is not designed to handle such many-to-many mappings. Solutions to this problem in the setting of gene set enrichment have been proposed \cite{Kankainen2011} and will be implemented in InCroMAP. 

Further future improvements concern the integration of visualizations from additional metabolomic and lipidomics databases, such as Reactome \cite{Eustachio2011} and LIPID MAPS \cite{Sud2007}. Particularly, the inclusion of visualizations based on LIPID MAPS pathways can overcome limitations of KEGG with respect to lipidomics data. Additionally, an automatic annotation with candidate identifiers for untargeted metabolomics data based on the comparison against theoretical adducts of metabolites from metabolomic databases is planned for a future release of InCroMAP.
